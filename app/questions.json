        "question": "Could you describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage?",
        "answer": "LocalStorage stores information as long as the user does not delete them. SessionStorage stores information as long as the session goes. Usually until the user closes the tab/browser. Cookies are simply cookies, which are supported by older browsers and usually are a fallback for frameworks that use the above mentioned WebStorages. In contrast cookies can store way less information then WebStorages and the information in WebStorages is never transferred to the server."

        "question": "Could you describe the techniques you know for hiding text but in order to make it readable by a screen reader?",
        "answer": "visibility: hidden. You hide the element but it's still present in the DOM. text-indent: -10000px; This approach moves the content to the left 10000 pixels - thus off the visible screen. position: absolute !important; clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); /* IE6, IE7 */ clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);"
